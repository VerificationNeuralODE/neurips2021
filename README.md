# Neurips 2021 - Reachability Analysis of Neural ODEs

## Instructions to reproduce results

### Installation and setup.

Go to the modified nnv repository [VerificationNeuralODE/nnv](https://github.com/VerificationNeuralODE/nnv) and follow the instructions on the Readme to install the dependencies and detup NNV.

###### Notes
 - Execution without installation will not work in this case as our nnv version is not in sync with the main branch of [verivital/nnv](https://github.com/verivital/nnv).
 - Step 4 is not necessary as we are not using those models.
 
 
 ### Reproducing results
 Clone the repo, open matlab and ensure Step 3 of the NNV installation is executed.
 
 Then, run the file [run_all.m](https://github.com/VerificationNeuralODE/neurips2021/blob/main/run_all.m) in the main folder to execute all experiments.
